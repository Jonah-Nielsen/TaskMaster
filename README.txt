The parts I worked on mainly are in the Taskmaster folder and are MainPage.xaml, MainPage.xaml.cs, MauiProgram.cs and in MainViewModel.cs located in the ViewModel folder.
I used the Mvvm community toolkit to link my commands to the buttons, which is why I have the ViewModel Folder. Thise Button Commands are in the MainPage.xaml and the MainViewModel.cs folder
